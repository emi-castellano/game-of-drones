# Game Of Drones

This project was created using ReactJS as frontend and NodeJS as backend.
The aim was to build the rock, scissors and paper game using the technologies mentioned above.

### Frontend Module

This module was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
I used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to control the whole state of the game.

### Backend Module

This module was built using `NodeJS` and `MongoDB` database to store the players and the results of each game.


### Installation steps

- Download the repository
- Run `npm install` on game-server and game-app folders
- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)
- If you want to see the DB, download [Mongo Compass Community](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#compass)
- On command prompt navigate to MongoDB installation folder, then on the bin folder run the command `mongod.exe`
- In game-server folder run the command `node server.js`  
- In game-app folder run the command `npm start`
- Now both apps should be running and you can play the game
